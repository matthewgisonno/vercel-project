        How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise?
      </Title>

      <P>
        I found this exercise both engaging and enjoyable, and it appears to
        effectively yield valuable insights about my knowledge and capabilities.
        Through this exercise, you can assess my familiarity with the Next.js
        framework and Vercel platform, as well as gain insights into my writing
        style. Additionally, it allows you to evaluate my thought process and
        problem-solving approach, particularly in terms of understanding an
        issue, formulating a solution, and communicating that solution to a
        customer.
      </P>

      <P>
        I am truly grateful for the opportunity to work with Vercel and eagerly
        anticipate hearing from my future team members. Thank you for your time!
      </P>
